# Top20 Movies

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Top 20 Trending Movies** is an android app that displays a scrollable list of the top trending movies from the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US">Movie Database API</a>. Users can view the movie poster, title and average movie rating.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **âœ¨ðŸ“½ðŸŽ‰**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item
- [x] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [x] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`
- [x] Use a downloadable font with custom color and size
- [x] Modify the theme of the app in `themes.xml`
- [x] Define and apply at least one style in **either** `themes.xml` or a new file `styles.xml`
- [x] Update the night theme to use different versions of styles when in dark mode
- [x] Use different drawables when in dark mode

## Notes

Throughout this project, I expanded my knowledge of working with API requests and data within Android Studio. Starting with an unfamiliar API, I studied the documentation to learn about authentication and query parameters required to retrieve a JSON object containing movie information. Using AsyncHTTPClient, I successfully executed an API call and retrieved the data. I then implemented a RecyclerView to display a scrolling list of the retrieved movie data and added item dividers using DividerItemDecoration. To provide further functionality, I also implemented a Toast message that would show when an item was clicked within the RecyclerView.

While working on this project, I encountered a challenge in modifying my mutable list I pass to the Adapter. I found that converting the element the list from a string to a JSON object allowed me more flexibility to properly manipulate the data and retrieve the necessary movie information. Additionally, I gained further knowledge of XML in managing image aspect ratios to ensure the movie poster was not cropped. I learned how to create a custom theme for an Android app by defining styles in an XML file and applying them to the app's activities or the entire app. I also learned how to override the default styles provided by the Android framework and create dark mode themes.

Overall, this project allowed me to strengthen my skills in working with API requests and data in Android Studio, as well as displaying that data within a RecyclerView.
